The sheer size of the raw data generated by a typical LCLS experiment makes it impossible for you to process it locally on your laptop. 
But do not despair! The LCLS Data Systems are here to help you.
We have familiarized ourselves in the [previous page](accounts.md) on how to *access* these systems.
We will now review the several ways that you can *use* to process your data.

# Interactive computing through `Jupyter`

# Batch computing using `SLURM`

# Automated computing through the `eLog`
