# Glossary

## Cameras and Detectors
Opal
:    Camera (single panel) used for visible light detection in the timetool at a number of instruments.

## DAQ-Related (Data acquisition)
Acqiris
:   Single or multi-channel DAQ boards for collecting and digitizing detector signals.

ADC
: **A**nalog-to-**d**igital **c**onverter.

DAQ
:    Data acquisition system for online/real-time signal processing.

EPICS
:    **E**xperimental **P**hysics and **I**ndustrial **C**ontrol **S**ystem - Software suite aiding control of the DAQ and all associated hardware. Facilitates signal acquisition, feedback loops, reporting, logging, and instrument timing among other things. Certain EPICS variables provide entry points for control of individual hardware components, others for access to and manipulation of data/data streams.

PV
:    **P**rocess **V**ariable. An EPICS variable.
