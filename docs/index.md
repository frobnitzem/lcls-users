# LCLS User Documentation

The goal of this documentation is to provide a single source of information for all stages of the LCLS experiment. Since the first experiments at LCLS, documentation has been written across a variety of locations. As a result, while there is a lot of good information out there, it can sometimes be hard to find, and it is not uncommon to run across an older, out-of-date, version. This current endeavor intends to simplify the search process by compiling all the available information on relevant topics into a single website. Where appropriate, additional references will also be listed at the bottom of the page.

This is a living document and a work in progress. While the general structure of the resource is not meant to change, individual pages will be added/modified/combined.

### How to read this documentation

This resource is organized into three categories of pages:

1. 'Before your experiment' pages
2. 'During your experiment' pages
3. 'After your experiment' pages

While the documentation can be read in any order, this organization is intended to better highlight pieces of information relevant to each of these stages of the experimental process. The first category includes more in depth information about the theory behind various tools (both hardware and software) available at LCLS. Logistical considerations, such as how to setup SLAC Unix computing accounts, are also covered. The second category of pages is meant to serve as a resource during the beamtime itself. Checklists and step-by-step guides are favored to provide concise, useful reminders which can be read quickly during the experiment. The final category of pages is more analysis oriented and should be a helpful resource when reprocessing data. This again includes explanations of the tools and algorithms, as well as tips and tricks from the accumulated experience of LCLS users and staff.

Finally, certain pages may be divided into two (or more) sections. While initially this documentation may be heavily focused on data analysis and software, it is the hope that the scope grows to include instrument controls, and other aspects of the experiment. It makes sense to include this complementary information on the same page for certain topics - the divisions are then intended to make filtering the information easier.
