> Serial crystallography at X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) sources has experienced tremendous progress in achieving high data rate in recent times. While this development offers potential to enable novel scientific investigations, such as imaging molecular events at logarithmic timescales, it also poses challenges in regards to real-time data analysis, which involves some degree of data reduction to only save those features or images pertaining to the science on disks. If data reduction is not effective, it could directly result in a substantial increase in facility budgetary requirements, or even hinder the utilization of ultra-high repetition imaging techniques making data analysis unwieldy. Furthermore, an additional challenge involves providing real-time feedback to users derived from real-time data analysis. In the context of serial crystallography, the initial and critical step in real-time data analysis is finding X-ray Bragg peaks from diffraction images. To tackle this challenge, we present PeakNet, a Bragg peak finder that utilizes neural networks and runs about four times faster than Psocake peak finder, while delivering significantly better indexing rates and comparable number of indexed events. We formulated the task of peak finding into a semantic segmentation problem, which is implemented as a classical U-Net architecture. A key advantage of PeakNet is its ability to scale linearly with respect to data volume, making it well-suited for real-time serial crystallography data analysis at high data rates.

> With X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), it is possible to determine the three-dimensional structure of noncrystalline nanoscale particles using X-ray single-particle imaging (SPI) techniques at room temperature. Classifying SPI scattering patterns, or “speckles", to extract single hits that are needed for real-time vetoing and three-dimensional reconstruction poses a challenge for high data rate facilities like European XFEL and LCLS-II-HE. Here, we introduce SpeckleNN, a unified embedding model for real-time speckle pattern classification with
limited labeled examples that can scale linearly with dataset size. Trained with twin neural networks, SpeckleNN maps speckle patterns to a unified embedding vector space, where similarity
is measured by Euclidean distance. We highlight its few-shot
classification capability on new never-seen samples and its robust
performance despite only tens of labels per classification category
even in the presence of substantial missing detector areas.
Without the need for excessive manual labeling or even a full
detector image, our classification method offers a great solution
for real-time high-throughput SPI experiments.

> The observation and description of collective excitations in solids is a fundamental issue when seeking to understand the physics of a many-body system. Analysis of these excitations is usually carried out by measuring
the dynamical structure factor, S(Q,ω), with inelastic neutron or x-ray scattering techniques and comparing this
against a calculated dynamical model. Here, we develop an artificial intelligence framework which combines
a neural network trained to mimic simulated data from a model Hamiltonian with automatic differentiation to
recover unknown parameters from experimental data. We benchmark this approach on a Linear Spin Wave
Theory (LSWT) simulator and advanced inelastic neutron scattering data from the square-lattice spin-1 antiferromagnet La2NiO4. We find that the model predicts the unknown parameters with excellent agreement relative
to analytical fitting. In doing so, we illustrate the ability to build and train a differentiable model only once,
which then can be applied in real-time to multi-dimensional scattering data, without the need for human-guided
peak finding and fitting algorithms. This prototypical approach promises a new technology for this field to
automatically detect and refine more advanced models for ordered quantum systems.

> X-ray free electron laser experiments have brought unique capabilities and opened new directions in research, such as creating new states of
matter or directly measuring atomic motion. One such area is the ability to use finely spaced sets of coherent x-ray pulses to be compared
after scattering from a dynamic system at different times. This enables the study of fluctuations in many-body quantum systems at the level
of the ultrafast pulse durations, but this method has been limited to a select number of examples and required complex and advanced analytical tools. By applying a new methodology to this problem, we have made qualitative advances in three separate areas that will likely also find
application to new fields. As compared to the “droplet-type” models, which typically are used to estimate the photon distributions on pixelated detectors to obtain the coherent x-ray speckle patterns, our algorithm achieves an order of magnitude speedup on CPU hardware and
two orders of magnitude improvement on GPU hardware. We also find that it retains accuracy in low-contrast conditions, which is the typical regime for many experiments in structural dynamics. Finally, it can predict photon distributions in high average-intensity applications, a
regime which up until now has not been accessible. Our artificial intelligence-assisted algorithm will enable a wider adoption of x-ray coherence spectroscopies, by both automating previously challenging analyses and enabling new experiments that were not otherwise feasible without the developments described in this work.

> Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a tool of fundamental importance in structural biology, helping us understand the basic building blocks of life. The algorithmic challenge of cryo-EM is to jointly estimate the unknown 3D poses and the 3D electron scattering potential of a biomolecule from millions of extremely noisy 2D images. Existing reconstruction algorithms, however, cannot easily keep pace with the rapidly growing size of cryo-EM datasets due to their high computational and memory cost. We introduce cryoAI, an ab initio reconstruction algorithm for homogeneous conformations that uses direct gradient-based optimization of particle poses and the electron scattering potential from single-particle cryo-EM data. CryoAI combines a learned encoder that predicts the poses of each particle image with a physics-based decoder to aggregate each particle image into an implicit representation of the scattering potential volume. This volume is stored in the Fourier domain for computational efficiency and leverages a modern coordinate network architecture for memory efficiency. Combined with a symmetric loss function, this framework achieves results of a quality on par with state-of-the-art cryo-EM solvers for both simulated and experimental data, one order of magnitude faster for large datasets and with significantly lower memory requirements than existing methods.

> Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an imaging modality that provides unique insights into the dynamics of proteins and other building blocks of life. The algorithmic challenge of jointly estimating the poses, 3D structure, and conformational heterogeneity of a biomolecule from millions of noisy and randomly oriented 2D projections in a computationally efficient manner, however, remains unsolved. Our method, cryoFIRE, performs ab initio heterogeneous reconstruction with unknown poses in an amortized framework, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive step of pose search while enabling the analysis of conformational heterogeneity. Poses and conformation are jointly estimated by an encoder while a physics-based decoder aggregates the images into an implicit neural representation of the conformational space. We show that our method can provide one order of magnitude speedup on datasets containing millions of images, without any loss of accuracy. We validate that the joint estimation of poses and conformations can be amortized over the size of the dataset. For the first time, we prove that an amortized method can extract interpretable dynamic information from experimental datasets.
